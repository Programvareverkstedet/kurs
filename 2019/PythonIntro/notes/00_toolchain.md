# Tools needed to work efficiently with python

## Python
The interpreter, needed to run any python program.

### MacOS / Linux / BSD
Install the newest python available from your package manager.
At the moment 3.6 or 3.7.

### Windows / MacOS
Install the newest version from [the python foundation](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## PIP
A package manager for python libraries (and more). Maybe the best part of python.

It comes with most new installations of python, if not try the following:

### MacOS / Linux / BSD
Install the newest python available from your package manager.
Note that, if python 2 is installed pip will install packages for python2 and pip3 packages for python3.

### Windows
It might come with the python installation.

Try
```
python3 -m pip install <package name>
```
If not, try installing it from wsl.

If all else fails, it probably includes running random binary scripts as administrator, good luck.

## A good editor
Learning python is mostly useless if you cant write something in it, find a good editor.

Recommendations:
- PyCharm
- Spyder
- Thonny
- VSCode (or VSCodium)
- Atom
- Emacs
- Vim
- Notepad++
